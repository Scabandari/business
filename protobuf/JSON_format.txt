 rfq_data = {
        "quantity": 2000,
        "account_id": 1,  # Client's pk
        "product_number": 2, # Product's pk
        "product_category": 1  # Category's pk
    }
    
   This code snippet above is taken from client code. rfq_data is just a name, you can name your json whatever you want, quantity can be any positive number, account_id corresponds to my Client models and 1 is Canadian Tire. product_number corresponds to my Product models primary key so high numbers won't work since I only have created one or two Clients and product_category is similar.
